Let $A$ be a point in the plane, and $\ell$ a line not passing through $A$. Evan does not have a straightedge, but instead has a special compass which has the ability to draw a circle through three distinct noncollinear points. (The center of the circle is not marked in this process.) Additionally, Evan can mark the intersections between two objects drawn, and can mark an arbitrary point on a given object or on the plane.

(i) Can Evan construct* the reflection of $A$ over $\ell$?

(ii) Can Evan construct the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\ell$?

*To construct a point, Evan must have an algorithm which marks the point in finitely many steps.

On the circle, 99 points are marked, dividing this circle into 99 equal arcs. Petya and Vasya play the game, taking turns. Petya goes first; on his first move, he paints in red or blue any marked point. Then each player can paint on his own turn, in red or blue, any uncolored marked point adjacent to the already painted one. Vasya wins, if after painting all points there is an equilateral triangle, all three vertices of which are colored in the same color. Could Petya prevent him?

On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth $\mathfrak{L}$ consisting of $n$ walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.

At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.

After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.

Alice secretly chooses a line and colors all points in the plane on one side of the line blue, and all points on the other side of the line red. Points on the line are colored blue, so every point in the plane is either red or blue. (Bob cannot see the colors of the points.)

One operation consists of choosing two elements $a_k$ and $a_{\ell}$ from a sequence, with $k\ne \ell $ , and replacing $a_{\ell}$ by $a'_{\ell}  = 2a_k - a_{\ell}$ .
Show that, given a collection of $2^n - 1$ Lima sequences, each one formed by $n$ integers, there are two of them, say $\beta$ and $\gamma$, such that it is possible to transform $\beta$ into $\gamma$ through a finite number of operations.

	In a country there are $n>100$ cities and initially no roads. The government randomly determined the cost of building a two-way road between any two cities, using all amounts from $1$ to $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ thalers once (all options are equally likely). The mayor of each city chooses the cheapest of the $n-1$ roads emanating from that city and it is built (this may be the mutual desired of the mayors of both cities being connected, or only one of the two).
After the construction of these roads, the cities are divided into $M$ connected components (between cities of the same connected component, you can get along the constructed roads, possibly via other cities, but this is not possible for cities of different components). Find the expected value of the random variable $M$.

	Ana plays a game on a $100\times 100$ chessboard. Initially, there is a white pawn on each square of the bottom row and a black pawn on each square of the top row, and no other pawns anywhere else.
Each white pawn moves toward the top row and each black pawn moves toward the bottom row in one of the following ways:
it moves to the square directly in front of it if there is no other pawn on it;
it captures a pawn on one of the diagonally adjacent squares in the row immediately in front of it if there is a pawn of the opposite color on it.
(We say a pawn $P$ captures a pawn $Q$ of the opposite color if we remove $Q$ from the board and move $P$ to the square that $Q$ was previously on.)

Ana can move any pawn (not necessarily alternating between black and white) according to those rules. What is the smallest number of pawns that can remain on the board after no more moves can be made?

Vulcan and Neptune play a turn-based game on an infinite grid of unit squares. Before the game starts, Neptune chooses a finite number of cells to be flooded. Vulcan is building a levee, which is a subset of unit edges of the grid (called walls) forming a connected, non-self-intersecting path or loop*.

The game then begins with Vulcan moving first. On each of Vulcan’s turns, he may add up to three new walls to the levee (maintaining the conditions for the levee). On each of Neptune’s turns, every cell which is adjacent to an already flooded cell and with no wall between them becomes flooded as well. Prove that Vulcan can always, in a finite number of turns, build the levee into a closed loop such that all flooded cells are contained in the interior of the loop, regardless of which cells Neptune initially floods.
*More formally, there must exist lattice points $\mbox{\footnotesize \(A_0, A_1, \dotsc, A_k\)}$, pairwise distinct except possibly $\mbox{\footnotesize \(A_0 = A_k\)}$, such that the set of walls is exactly $\mbox{\footnotesize \(\{A_0A_1, A_1A_2, \dotsc , A_{k-1}A_k\}\)}$. Once a wall is built it cannot be destroyed; in particular, if the levee is a closed loop (i.e. $\mbox{\footnotesize \(A_0 = A_k\)}$) then Vulcan cannot add more walls. Since each wall has length $\mbox{\footnotesize \(1\)}$, the length of the levee is $\mbox{\footnotesize \(k\)}$.

A total of $d$ roads were built. Some oligarchs wanted to create a corporation by combining their cities and roads so that from any city of the corporation you can go to any city of the corporation using only corporation roads (roads can go to other cities outside corporation) but it turned out that no group of less than $N$ oligarchs can create a corporation. What is the maximal amount that $d$ can have?

	One hundred sages play the following game. They are waiting in some fixed order in front of a room. The sages enter the room one after another. When a sage enters the room, the following happens - the guard in the room chooses two arbitrary distinct numbers from the set {$1,2,3$}, and announces them to the sage in the room. Then the sage chooses one of those numbers, tells it to the guard, and leaves the room, and the next enters, and so on. During the game, before a sage chooses a number, he can ask the guard what were the chosen numbers of the previous two sages. During the game, the sages cannot talk to each other. At the end, when everyone has finished, the game is considered as a failure if the sum of the 100 chosen numbers is exactly $200$; else it is successful. Prove that the sages can create a strategy, by which they can win the game.

  Calvin and Hobbes play a game.
  First, Hobbes picks a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets
  of $\{1, 2, \dots, 2020\}$, known to both players.
  Then, Calvin and Hobbes take turns choosing a number
  from $\{1, 2, \dots, 2020\}$
  which is not already chosen, with Calvin going first,
  until all numbers are taken (i.e., each player has $1010$ numbers).
  Calvin wins if he has chosen all the elements
  of some member of $\mathcal F$, otherwise Hobbes wins.
  What is the largest possible size of a family $\mathcal F$ that Hobbes
  could pick while still having a winning strategy?

Ann and Beto play with a two pan balance scale. They have $2023$ dumbbells labeled with their weights, which are the numbers $1, 2, \dots, 2023$, with none of them repeating themselves. Each player, in turn, chooses a dumbbell that was not yet placed on the balance scale and places it on the pan with the least weight at the moment. If the scale is balanced, the player places it on any pan. Ana starts the game, and they continue in this way alternately until all the dumbbells are placed. Ana wins if at the end the scale is balanced, otherwise Beto win. Determine which of the players has a winning strategy and describe the strategy.
