	Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AC > AB > BC$. The perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $AB$ cut line $BC$ at $D$ and $E$ respectively. Let $P$ and $Q$ be points on lines $AC$ and $AB$ respectively, both different from $A$, such that $AB = BP$ and $AC = CQ$, and let $K$ be the intersection of lines $EP$ and $DQ$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Show that $\angle DKA = \angle EKM$.
