The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminum (denoted A) and bronze (denoted B). Marianne has $n$ aluminum coins and $n$ bronze coins arranged in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A chain is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer $k \leq 2n$, Gilberty repeatedly performs the following operation: he identifies the longest chain containing the $k^{th}$ coin from the left and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if $n=4$ and $k=4$, the process starting from the ordering $AABBBABA$ would be $AABBBABA \to BBBAAABA \to AAABBBBA \to BBBBAAAA \to ...$

Find all pairs $(n,k)$ with $1 \leq k \leq 2n$ such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost $n$ coins will all be of the same type.

In each square of a garden shaped like a $2022 \times 2022$ board, there is initially a tree of height $0$. A gardener and a lumberjack alternate turns playing the following game, with the gardener taking the first turn:
The gardener chooses a square in the garden. Each tree on that square and all the surrounding squares (of which there are at most eight) then becomes one unit taller.
The lumberjack then chooses four different squares on the board. Each tree of positive height on those squares then becomes one unit shorter.
We say that a tree is majestic if its height is at least $10^6$. Determine the largest $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board, no matter how the lumberjack plays.

We say that a path from $X$ to $Y$ is a sequence of roads such that one can move from $X$ to $Y$ along this sequence without returning to an already visited city. A collection of paths is called diverse if no road belongs to two or more paths in the collection.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two distinct cities in Anisotropy. Let $N_{AB}$ denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from $A$ to $B$. Similarly, let $N_{BA}$ denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from $B$ to $A$. Prove that the equality $N_{AB} = N_{BA}$ holds if and only if the number of roads going out from $A$ is the same as the number of roads going out from $B$.

	A hunter and an invisible rabbit play a game on an infinite square grid. First the hunter fixes a colouring of the cells with finitely many colours. The rabbit then secretly chooses a cell to start in. Every minute, the rabbit reports the colour of its current cell to the hunter, and then secretly moves to an adjacent cell that it has not visited before (two cells are adjacent if they share an edge). The hunter wins if after some finite time either:
the rabbit cannot move; or
the hunter can determine the cell in which the rabbit started.
Decide whether there exists a winning strategy for the hunter.

A magician intends to perform the following trick. She announces a positive integer $n$, along with $2n$ real numbers $x_1 < \dots < x_{2n}$, to the audience. A member of the audience then secretly chooses a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ with real coefficients, computes the $2n$ values $P(x_1), \dots , P(x_{2n})$, and writes down these $2n$ values on the blackboard in non-decreasing order. After that the magician announces the secret polynomial to the audience. Can the magician find a strategy to perform such a trick?

There is an integer $n > 1$. There are $n^2$ stations on a slope of a mountain, all at different altitudes. Each of two cable car companies, $A$ and $B$, operates $k$ cable cars; each cable car provides a transfer from one of the stations to a higher one (with no intermediate stops). The $k$ cable cars of $A$ have $k$ different starting points and $k$ different finishing points, and a cable car which starts higher also finishes higher. The same conditions hold for $B$. We say that two stations are linked by a company if one can start from the lower station and reach the higher one by using one or more cars of that company (no other movements between stations are allowed). Determine the smallest positive integer $k$ for which one can guarantee that there are two stations that are linked by both companies.

He repeatedly performs the following operation: if there are exactly $k>0$ coins showing $H$, then he turns over the $k$th coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show $T$ and he stops. For example, if $n=3$ the process starting with the configuration $THT$ would be $THT \to HHT  \to HTT \to TTT$, which stops after three operations.

(a) Show that, for each initial configuration, Harry stops after a finite number of operations.

(b) For each initial configuration $C$, let $L(C)$ be the number of operations before Harry stops. For example, $L(THT) = 3$ and $L(TTT) = 0$. Determine the average value of $L(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$.

On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth $\mathfrak{L}$ consisting of $n$ walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.

At the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.

After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.

Let $k(\mathfrak{L})$ be the largest number $k$ such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth $\mathfrak{L},$ Morgana can always place at least $k$ knights such that no two of them can ever meet. For each $n,$ what are all possible values for $k(\mathfrak{L}),$ where $\mathfrak{L}$ is a labyrinth with $n$ walls?

	A site is any point $(x, y)$ in the plane such that $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers less than or equal to 20.

Initially, each of the 400 sites is unoccupied. Amy and Ben take turns placing stones with Amy going first. On her turn, Amy places a new red stone on an unoccupied site such that the distance between any two sites occupied by red stones is not equal to $\sqrt{5}$. On his turn, Ben places a new blue stone on any unoccupied site. (A site occupied by a blue stone is allowed to be at any distance from any other occupied site.) They stop as soon as a player cannot place a stone.

Find the greatest $K$ such that Amy can ensure that she places at least $K$ red stones, no matter how Ben places his blue stones.

	Let $n$ be a given positive integer. Sisyphus performs a sequence of turns on a board consisting of $n + 1$ squares in a row, numbered $0$ to $n$ from left to right. Initially, $n$ stones are put into square $0$, and the other squares are empty. At every turn, Sisyphus chooses any nonempty square, say with $k$ stones, takes one of these stones and moves it to the right by at most $k$ squares (the stone should say within the board). Sisyphus' aim is to move all $n$ stones to square $n$.
Prove that Sisyphus cannot reach the aim in less than

An interstellar hotel has $100$ rooms with capacities $101,102,\ldots, 200$ people. These rooms are occupied by $n$ people in total. Now a VIP guest is about to arrive and the owner wants to provide him with a personal room. On that purpose, the owner wants to choose two rooms $A$ and $B$ and move all guests from $A$ to $B$ without exceeding its capacity. Determine the largest $n$ for which the owner can be sure that he can achieve his goal no matter what the initial distribution of the guests is.

On the circle, 99 points are marked, dividing this circle into 99 equal arcs. Petya and Vasya play the game, taking turns. Petya goes first; on his first move, he paints in red or blue any marked point. Then each player can paint on his own turn, in red or blue, any uncolored marked point adjacent to the already painted one. Vasya wins, if after painting all points there is an equilateral triangle, all three vertices of which are colored in the same color. Could Petya prevent him?

Initially, there is a violet counter on a field in the left part, and a purple counter on a field in the right part. Lyosha and Pasha alternatively play their turn, starting from Pasha, by moving their chip (Lyosha-violet, and Pasha-purple) over a segment to other field that has no chip. It’s prohibited to repeat a position twice, i.e. can’t move to position that already been occupied by some earlier turns in the game. A player losses if he can’t make a move.

Let $b\geq2$ and $w\geq2$ be fixed integers, and $n=b+w$. Given are $2b$ identical black rods and $2w$ identical white rods, each of side length 1.

We assemble a regular $2n-$gon using these rods so that parallel sides are the same color. Then, a convex $2b$-gon $B$ is formed by translating the black rods, and a convex $2w$-gon $W$ is formed by translating the white rods. An example of one way of doing the assembly when $b=3$ and $w=2$ is shown below, as well as the resulting polygons $B$ and $W$.

real w = 2*Sin(18);
real h = 0.10 * w;
real d = 0.33 * h;

draw(wht, (0,0)--(w,0)--(w+d,h)--(-d,h)--cycle);
fill(blk, (0,0)--(w,0)--(w+d,h)--(-d,h)--cycle, black);

// draw(unitcircle, blue+dotted);

// Original polygon
add(shift(dir(108))*blk);
add(shift(dir(72))*rotate(324)*blk);
add(shift(dir(36))*rotate(288)*wht);
add(shift(dir(0))*rotate(252)*blk);

add(shift(dir(288))*rotate(180)*blk);
add(shift(dir(252))*rotate(144)*blk);
add(shift(dir(216))*rotate(108)*wht);
add(shift(dir(180))*rotate(72)*blk);
add(shift(dir(144))*rotate(36)*wht);

// White shifted
real Wk = 1.2;
pair W1 = (1.8,0.1);
pair W2 = W1 + w*dir(36);
pair W3 = W2 + w*dir(108);
pair W4 = W3 + w*dir(216);
path Wgon = W1--W2--W3--W4--cycle;
draw(Wgon);
pair WO = (W1+W3)/2;
transform Wt = shift(WO)*scale(Wk)*shift(-WO);
draw(Wt * Wgon);
label("$W$", WO);
/*
draw(W1--Wt*W1);
draw(W2--Wt*W2);
draw(W3--Wt*W3);
draw(W4--Wt*W4);
*/

// Black shifted
real Bk = 1.10;
pair B1 = (1.5,-0.1);
pair B2 = B1 + w*dir(0);
pair B3 = B2 + w*dir(324);
pair B4 = B3 + w*dir(252);
pair B5 = B4 + w*dir(180);
pair B6 = B5 + w*dir(144);

The Planar National Park is a subset of the Euclidean plane consisting of several trails which meet at junctions. Every trail has its two endpoints at two different junctions whereas each junction is the endpoint of exactly three trails. Trails only intersect at junctions (in particular, trails only meet at endpoints). Finally, no trails begin and end at the same two junctions. (An example of one possible layout of the park is shown to the left below, in which there are six junctions and nine trails.)
IMAGE 
A visitor walks through the park as follows: she begins at a junction and starts walking along a trail. At the end of that first trail, she enters a junction and turns left. On the next junction she turns right, and so on, alternating left and right turns at each junction. She does this until she gets back to the junction where she started. What is the largest possible number of times she could have entered any junction during her walk, over all possible layouts of the park?

Suppose that the circumcircle of $\triangle ABE$ intersects line $CB$ at $B$ and $P$, and the circumcircle of $\triangle ADE$ intersects line $CD$ at $D$ and $Q$, where $C,B,P,G$ and $C,Q,D,F$ are collinear in that order. Prove that if lines $FP$ and $GQ$ intersect at $M$, then $\angle MAC = 90^\circ$.

	There are $2022$ equally spaced points on a circular track $\gamma$ of circumference $2022$. The points are labeled $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{2022}$ in some order, each label used once. Initially, Bunbun the Bunny begins at $A_1$. She hops along $\gamma$ from $A_1$ to $A_2$, then from $A_2$ to $A_3$, until she reaches $A_{2022}$, after which she hops back to $A_1$. When hopping from $P$ to $Q$, she always hops along the shorter of the two arcs $\widehat{PQ}$ of $\gamma$; if $\overline{PQ}$ is a diameter of $\gamma$, she moves along either semicircle.

Determine the maximal possible sum of the lengths of the $2022$ arcs which Bunbun traveled, over all possible labellings of the $2022$ points.

Let $m$ and $n$ be fixed positive integers. Tsvety and Freyja play a game on an infinite grid of unit square cells. Tsvety has secretly written a real number inside of each cell so that the sum of the numbers within every rectangle of size either $m$ by $n$ or $n$ by $m$ is zero. Freyja wants to learn all of these numbers.

One by one, Freyja asks Tsvety about some cell in the grid, and Tsvety truthfully reveals what number is written in it. Freyja wins if, at any point, Freyja can simultaneously deduce the number written in every cell of the entire infinite grid (If this never occurs, Freyja has lost the game and Tsvety wins).

In terms of $m$ and $n$, find the smallest number of questions that Freyja must ask to win, or show that no finite number of questions suffice.

	Let $A_1$, $\ldots$, $A_{2022}$ be the vertices of a regular $2022$-gon in the plane. Alice and Bob play a game. Alice secretly chooses a line and colors all points in the plane on one side of the line blue, and all points on the other side of the line red. Points on the line are colored blue, so every point in the plane is either red or blue. (Bob cannot see the colors of the points.)

In each round, Bob chooses a point in the plane (not necessarily among $A_1, \ldots, A_{2022}$) and Alice responds truthfully with the color of that point. What is the smallest number $Q$ for which Bob has a strategy to always determine the colors of points $A_1, \ldots, A_{2022}$ in $Q$ rounds?

Vulcan and Neptune play a turn-based game on an infinite grid of unit squares. Before the game starts, Neptune chooses a finite number of cells to be flooded. Vulcan is building a levee, which is a subset of unit edges of the grid (called walls) forming a connected, non-self-intersecting path or loop*.

The game then begins with Vulcan moving first. On each of Vulcan’s turns, he may add up to three new walls to the levee (maintaining the conditions for the levee). On each of Neptune’s turns, every cell which is adjacent to an already flooded cell and with no wall between them becomes flooded as well. Prove that Vulcan can always, in a finite number of turns, build the levee into a closed loop such that all flooded cells are contained in the interior of the loop, regardless of which cells Neptune initially floods.
*More formally, there must exist lattice points $\mbox{\footnotesize \(A_0, A_1, \dotsc, A_k\)}$, pairwise distinct except possibly $\mbox{\footnotesize \(A_0 = A_k\)}$, such that the set of walls is exactly $\mbox{\footnotesize \(\{A_0A_1, A_1A_2, \dotsc , A_{k-1}A_k\}\)}$. Once a wall is built it cannot be destroyed; in particular, if the levee is a closed loop (i.e. $\mbox{\footnotesize \(A_0 = A_k\)}$) then Vulcan cannot add more walls. Since each wall has length $\mbox{\footnotesize \(1\)}$, the length of the levee is $\mbox{\footnotesize \(k\)}$.

A $3 \times 3$ grid of unit cells is given. A snake of length $k$ is an animal which occupies an ordered $k$-tuple of cells in this grid, say $(s_1, \dots, s_k)$. These cells must be pairwise distinct, and $s_i$ and $s_{i+1}$ must share a side for $i = 1, \dots, k-1$. After being placed in a finite $n \times n$ grid, if the snake is currently occupying $(s_1, \dots, s_k)$ and $s$ is an unoccupied cell sharing a side with $s_1$, the snake can move to occupy $(s, s_1, \dots, s_{k-1})$ instead. The snake has turned around if it occupied $(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k)$ at the beginning, but after a finite number of moves occupies $(s_k, s_{k-1}, \dots, s_1)$ instead.

	Ana plays a game on a $100\times 100$ chessboard. Initially, there is a white pawn on each square of the bottom row and a black pawn on each square of the top row, and no other pawns anywhere else.
Each white pawn moves toward the top row and each black pawn moves toward the bottom row in one of the following ways:
it moves to the square directly in front of it if there is no other pawn on it;
it captures a pawn on one of the diagonally adjacent squares in the row immediately in front of it if there is a pawn of the opposite color on it.
(We say a pawn $P$ captures a pawn $Q$ of the opposite color if we remove $Q$ from the board and move $P$ to the square that $Q$ was previously on.)

Ana can move any pawn (not necessarily alternating between black and white) according to those rules. What is the smallest number of pawns that can remain on the board after no more moves can be made?

One operation consists of choosing two elements $a_k$ and $a_{\ell}$ from a sequence, with $k\ne \ell $ , and replacing $a_{\ell}$ by $a'_{\ell}  = 2a_k - a_{\ell}$ .
Show that, given a collection of $2^n - 1$ Lima sequences, each one formed by $n$ integers, there are two of them, say $\beta$ and $\gamma$, such that it is possible to transform $\beta$ into $\gamma$ through a finite number of operations.

Notes.
The sequences $(1,2,2,7)$ and $(2,7,2,1)$ have the same elements but are different.
If all the elements of a sequence are equal, then that sequence is not Lima.

	Don Miguel places a token in one of the $(n+1)^2$ vertices determined by an $n \times n$ board. A move consists of moving the token from the vertex on which it is placed to an adjacent vertex which is at most $\sqrt2$ away, as long as it stays on the board. A path is a sequence of moves such that the token was in each one of the $(n+1)^2$ vertices exactly once. What is the maximum number of diagonal moves (those of length $\sqrt2$) that a path can have in total?

(i) If $a$ and $b$ are different integers on the board, then we can write $a + b$ on the board, if it is not
already there.
(ii) If $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three different integers on the board, and if an integer $x$ satisfies $ax^2 +bx+c = 0$,
then we can write $x$ on the board, if it is not already there.

Determine all pairs of starting numbers $(u, v)$ from which any integer can eventually be written on the board after a finite sequence of steps.

On a circle, Alina draws $2019$ chords, the endpoints of which are all different. A point is considered marked if it is either

$\text{(i)}$ one of the $4038$ endpoints of a chord; or

$\text{(ii)}$ an intersection point of at least two chords.

Alina labels each marked point. Of the $4038$ points meeting criterion $\text{(i)}$, Alina labels $2019$ points with a $0$ and the other $2019$ points with a $1$. She labels each point meeting criterion $\text{(ii)}$ with an arbitrary integer (not necessarily positive).
Along each chord, Alina considers the segments connecting two consecutive marked points. (A chord with $k$ marked points has $k-1$ such segments.) She labels each such segment in yellow with the sum of the labels of its two endpoints and in blue with the absolute value of their difference.
Alina finds that the $N + 1$ yellow labels take each value $0, 1, . . . , N$ exactly once. Show that at least one blue label is a multiple of $3$.
(A chord is a line segment joining two different points on a circle.)

First, he chooses an endpoint of each segment as a “sink”. Then he places the present at
the endpoint of the segment he is at. The present moves as follows :
$\bullet$ If it is on a line segment, it moves towards the sink.
$\bullet$ When it reaches an intersection of two segments, it changes the line segment it travels on and starts moving towards the new sink.
If the present reaches an endpoint, the friend on that endpoint can receive their present.

Let $n \geq 3$ be a fixed integer. The number $1$ is written $n$ times on a blackboard. Below the blackboard, there are two buckets that are initially empty. A move consists of erasing two of the numbers $a$ and $b$, replacing them with the numbers $1$ and $a+b$, then adding one stone to the first bucket and $\gcd(a, b)$ stones to the second bucket. After some finite number of moves, there are $s$ stones in the first bucket and $t$ stones in the second bucket, where $s$ and $t$ are positive integers. Find all possible values of the ratio $\frac{t}{s}$.

	Consider a $2018 \times 2019$ board with integers in each unit square. Two unit squares are said to be neighbours if they share a common edge. In each turn, you choose some unit squares. Then for each chosen unit square the average of all its neighbours is calculated. Finally, after these calculations are done, the number in each chosen unit square is replaced by the corresponding average.
Is it always possible to make the numbers in all squares become the same after finitely many turns?

Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle. From the vertex $A$ we draw a ray towards the interior of the triangle such that the ray reaches one of the sides of the triangle. When the ray reaches a side, it then bounces off following the law of reflection, that is, if it arrives with a directed angle $\alpha$, it leaves with a directed angle $180^{\circ}-\alpha$. After $n$ bounces, the ray returns to $A$ without ever landing on any of the other two vertices. Find all possible values of $n$.

Let $q$ be a real number. Gugu has a napkin with ten distinct real numbers written on it, and he writes the following three lines of real numbers on the blackboard:
In the first line, Gugu writes down every number of the form $a-b$, where $a$ and $b$ are two (not necessarily distinct) numbers on his napkin.
In the second line, Gugu writes down every number of the form $qab$, where $a$ and $b$ are
two (not necessarily distinct) numbers from the first line.
In the third line, Gugu writes down every number of the form $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$, where $a, b, c, d$ are four (not necessarily distinct) numbers from the first line.
Determine all values of $q$ such that, regardless of the numbers on Gugu's napkin, every number in the second line is also a number in the third line.

Choose any number of the form $2^j$, where $j$ is a non-negative integer, and put it into an empty cell.
Choose two (not necessarily adjacent) cells with the same number in them; denote that number by $2^j$. Replace the number in one of the cells with $2^{j+1}$ and erase the number in the other cell.
At the end of the game, one cell contains $2^n$, where $n$ is a given positive integer, while the other cells are empty. Determine the maximum number of moves that Sir Alex could have made, in terms of $n$.

A hunter and an invisible rabbit play a game in the Euclidean plane. The rabbit's starting point, $A_0,$ and the hunter's starting point, $B_0$ are the same. After $n-1$ rounds of the game, the rabbit is at point $A_{n-1}$ and the hunter is at point $B_{n-1}.$ In the $n^{\text{th}}$ round of the game, three things occur in order:
The rabbit moves invisibly to a point $A_n$ such that the distance between $A_{n-1}$ and $A_n$ is exactly $1.$
A tracking device reports a point $P_n$ to the hunter. The only guarantee provided by the tracking device to the hunter is that the distance between $P_n$ and $A_n$ is at most $1.$
The hunter moves visibly to a point $B_n$ such that the distance between $B_{n-1}$ and $B_n$ is exactly $1.$
Is it always possible, no matter how the rabbit moves, and no matter what points are reported by the tracking device, for the hunter to choose her moves so that after $10^9$ rounds, she can ensure that the distance between her and the rabbit is at most $100?$

Eduardo and Fernando play the following game making moves alternately: in each move, the current player chooses an index $i$ in the set $\{0,1,2,\ldots, p-1 \}$ that was not chosen before by either of the two players and then chooses an element $a_i$ from the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$. Eduardo has the first move. The game ends after all the indices have been chosen .Then the following number is computed:
$$M=a_0+a_110+a_210^2+\cdots+a_{p-1}10^{p-1}= \sum_{i=0}^{p-1}a_i.10^i$$.

In Lineland there are $n\geq1$ towns, arranged along a road running from left to right. Each town has a left bulldozer (put to the left of the town and facing left) and a right bulldozer (put to the right of the town and facing right). The sizes of the $2n$ bulldozers are distinct. Every time when a left and right bulldozer confront each other, the larger bulldozer pushes the smaller one off the road. On the other hand, bulldozers are quite unprotected at their rears; so, if a bulldozer reaches the rear-end of another one, the first one pushes the second one off the road, regardless of their sizes.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two towns, with $B$ to the right of $A$. We say that town $A$ can sweep town $B$ away if the right bulldozer of $A$ can move over to $B$ pushing off all bulldozers it meets. Similarly town $B$ can sweep town $A$ away if the left bulldozer of $B$ can move over to $A$ pushing off all bulldozers of all towns on its way.

Prove that there is exactly one town that cannot be swept away by any other one.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Two players $A$ and $B$ play a game in which they take turns choosing positive integers $k \le n$. The rules of the game are:

(i) A player cannot choose a number that has been chosen by either player on any previous turn.
(ii) A player cannot choose a number consecutive to any of those the player has already chosen on any previous turn.
(iii) The game is a draw if all numbers have been chosen; otherwise the player who cannot choose a number anymore loses the game.

The player $A$ takes the first turn. Determine the outcome of the game, assuming that both players use optimal strategies.

For a sequence $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ of real numbers, we define its $\textit{price}$ as\[\max_{1\le i\le n}|x_1+\cdots +x_i|.\]Given $n$ real numbers, Dave and George want to arrange them into a sequence with a low price. Diligent Dave checks all possible ways and finds the minimum possible price $D$. Greedy George, on the other hand, chooses $x_1$ such that $|x_1 |$ is as small as possible; among the remaining numbers, he chooses $x_2$ such that $|x_1 + x_2 |$ is as small as possible, and so on. Thus, in the $i$-th step he chooses $x_i$ among the remaining numbers so as to minimise the value of $|x_1 + x_2 + \cdots  x_i |$. In each step, if several numbers provide the same value, George chooses one at random. Finally he gets a sequence with price $G$.

Find the least possible constant $c$ such that for every positive integer $n$, for every collection of $n$ real numbers, and for every possible sequence that George might obtain, the resulting values satisfy the inequality $G\le cD$.

A configuration of $4027$ points in the plane is called Colombian if it consists of $2013$ red points and $2014$ blue points, and no three of the points of the configuration are collinear. By drawing some lines, the plane is divided into several regions. An arrangement of lines is good for a Colombian configuration if the following two conditions are satisfied:

i) No line passes through any point of the configuration.

ii) No region contains points of both colors.

Find the least value of $k$ such that for any Colombian configuration of $4027$ points, there is a good arrangement of $k$ lines.

	A crazy physicist discovered a new kind of particle wich he called an imon, after some of them mysteriously appeared in his lab. Some pairs of imons in the lab can be entangled, and each imon can participate in many entanglement relations. The physicist has found a way to perform the following two kinds of operations with these particles, one operation at a time.
(i) If some imon is entangled with an odd number of other imons in the lab, then the physicist can destroy it.
(ii) At any moment, he may double the whole family of imons in the lab by creating a copy $I'$ of each imon $I$. During this procedure, the two copies $I'$ and $J'$ become entangled if and only if the original imons $I$ and $J$ are entangled, and each copy $I'$ becomes entangled with its original imon $I$; no other entanglements occur or disappear at this moment.

Prove that the physicist may apply a sequence of such operations resulting in a family of imons, no two of which are entangled.

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $A$ be a subset of $\{ 1,\cdots ,n\}$. An $A$-partition of $n$ into $k$ parts is a representation of n as a sum $n = a_1 + \cdots + a_k$, where the parts $a_1 , \cdots , a_k $ belong to $A$ and are not necessarily distinct. The number of different parts in such a partition is the number of (distinct) elements in the set $\{ a_1 , a_2 , \cdots , a_k \} $.
We say that an $A$-partition of $n$ into $k$ parts is optimal if there is no $A$-partition of $n$ into $r$ parts with $r<k$. Prove that any optimal $A$-partition of $n$ contains at most $\sqrt[3]{6n}$ different parts.

Fix an integer $k>2$. Two players, called Ana and Banana, play the following game of numbers. Initially, some integer $n \ge k$ gets written on the blackboard. Then they take moves in turn, with Ana beginning. A player making a move erases the number $m$ just written on the blackboard and replaces it by some number $m'$ with $k \le m' < m$ that is coprime to $m$. The first player who cannot move anymore loses.

An integer $n \ge k $ is called good if Banana has a winning strategy when the initial number is $n$, and bad otherwise.

Consider two integers $n,n' \ge k$ with the property that each prime number $p \le k$ divides $n$ if and only if it divides $n'$. Prove that either both $n$ and $n'$ are good or both are bad.

Let $n > 0$ be an integer. We are given a balance and $n$ weights of weight $2^0, 2^1, \cdots, 2^{n-1}$. We are to place each of the $n$ weights on the balance, one after another, in such a way that the right pan is never heavier than the left pan. At each step we choose one of the weights that has not yet been placed on the balance, and place it on either the left pan or the right pan, until all of the weights have been placed.
Determine the number of ways in which this can be done.

	Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three points of $\mathcal S$ are collinear. A windmill is a process that starts with a line $\ell$ going through a single point $P \in \mathcal S$. The line rotates clockwise about the pivot $P$ until the first time that the line meets some other point belonging to $\mathcal S$. This point, $Q$, takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates clockwise about $Q$, until it next meets a point of $\mathcal S$. This process continues indefinitely.
Show that we can choose a point $P$ in $\mathcal S$ and a line $\ell$ going through $P$ such that the resulting windmill uses each point of $\mathcal S$ as a pivot infinitely many times.

Let $m$ be a positive integer, and consider a $m\times m$ checkerboard consisting of unit squares. At the centre of some of these unit squares there is an ant. At time $0$, each ant starts moving with speed $1$ parallel to some edge of the checkerboard. When two ants moving in the opposite directions meet, they both turn $90^{\circ}$ clockwise and continue moving with speed $1$. When more than $2$ ants meet, or when two ants moving in perpendicular directions meet, the ants continue moving in the same direction as before they met. When an ant reaches one of the edges of the checkerboard, it falls off and will not re-appear.

Considering all possible starting positions, determine the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard, or prove that such a moment does not necessarily exist.

Alan thinks of a polynomial $Q(x,y)$ with real coefficients and degree at most $d$ and keeps it secret. Allen can make queries of the form $(s,t)$, where $s$ and $t$ are real numbers such that $P(s,t)\neq0$. Alan must respond with the value $Q(s,t)$. Allen's goal is to determine whether $P$ divides $Q$. Find (in terms of $P$ and $d$) the smallest positive integer, $g$, such that Allen can always achieve this goal making no more than $g$ queries.

The computer picks a tree $T$ such that no vertex of $T$ has degree $2$ and such that $T$ has exactly $n$ leaves, labeled $v_1,\ldots, v_n$. The computer then puts an integer weight on each edge of $T$, and shows Ben neither the tree $T$ nor the weights. Ben can ask queries by specifying two integers $1\leq i < j \leq n$, and the computer will return the sum of the weights on the path from $v_i$ to $v_j$. At any point, Ben can guess whether the tree's weights are all zero. He wins the game if he is correct, and loses if he is incorrect.

Alice is performing a magic trick. She has a standard deck of 52 cards, which she may order beforehand. She invites a volunteer to pick an integer \(0\le n\le 52\), and cuts the deck into a pile with the top \(n\) cards and a pile with the remaining \(52-n\). She then gives both piles to the volunteer, who riffles them together and hands the deck back to her face down. (Thus, in the resulting deck, the cards that were in the deck of size \(n\) appear in order, as do the cards that were in the deck of size \(52-n\).)

Alice then flips the cards over one-by-one from the top. Before flipping over each card, she may choose to guess the color of the card she is about to flip over. She stops if she guesses incorrectly. What is the maximum number of correct guesses she can guarantee?

For \(1\le k\le n\), a python of length \(k\) is a snake that occupies \(k\) consecutive cells in a single row, and no other cells. Similarly, an anaconda of length \(k\) is a snake that occupies \(k\) consecutive cells in a single column, and no other cells.

The grid contains at least one python or anaconda, and it satisfies the following properties:
No cell is occupied by multiple snakes.
If a cell in the grid is immediately to the left or immediately to the right of a python, then that cell must be occupied by an anaconda.
If a cell in the grid is immediately to above or immediately below an anaconda, then that cell must be occupied by a python.

Prove that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the snakes is at least \(n^2\).

For which pairs $(m,n)$ can Carl necessarily accomplish his task, regardless of which $n$ points he is given?

*Here, the centroid of $n$ points with coordinates $(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ is the point with coordinates $\left( \frac{x_1 + \dots + x_n}{n}, \frac{y_1 + \dots + y_n}{n}\right)$.

In the game of Ring Mafia, there are $2019$ counters arranged in a circle. $673$ of these counters are mafia, and the remaining $1346$ counters are town. Two players, Tony and Madeline, take turns with Tony going first. Tony does not know which counters are mafia but Madeline does.

On Tony’s turn, he selects any subset of the counters (possibly the empty set) and removes all counters in that set. On Madeline’s turn, she selects a town counter which is adjacent to a mafia counter and removes it. Whenever counters are removed, the remaining counters are brought closer together without changing their order so that they still form a circle. The game ends when either all mafia counters have been removed, or all town counters have been removed.

Is there a strategy for Tony that guarantees, no matter where the mafia counters are placed and what Madeline does, that at least one town counter remains at the end of the game?

A positive integer is a good number, if its base $10$ representation can be split into at least $5$ sections, each section with a non-zero digit, and after interpreting each section as a positive integer (omitting leading zero digits), they can be split into two groups, such that each group can be reordered to form a geometric sequence (if a group has $1$ or $2$ numbers, it is also a geometric sequence), for example $20240327$ is a good number, since after splitting it as $2|02|403|2|7$, $2|02|2$ and $403|7$ form two groups of geometric sequences.

If $a>1$, $m>2$, $p=1+a+a^2+\dots+a^m$ is a prime, prove that $\frac{10^{p-1}-1}{p}$ is a good number.

An integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition.
Quote:
For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:
4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
The number of partitions of n is given by the partition function $p\left ( n \right )$. So $p\left ( 4 \right ) = 5$ .
Determine all the positive integers so that $p\left ( n \right )+p\left ( n+4 \right )=p\left ( n+2 \right )+p\left ( n+3 \right )$.
