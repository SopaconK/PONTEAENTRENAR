Let $P \in \mathbb{R}[x]$. Suppose that the multiset of real roots (where roots are counted with multiplicity) of $P(x)-x$ and $P^3(x)-x$ are distinct. Prove that for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $P^n(x)-x$ has at least $\sigma(n)-2$ distinct real roots.

(Here $P^n(x):=P(P^{n-1}(x))$ with $P^1(x) = P(x)$, and $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of all positive divisors of $n$).
