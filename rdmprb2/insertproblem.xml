	Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle. $D$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. $H$ is the orthocenter, $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, and $N$ is the midpoint of $AH$. Tangents from $B$ and $C$ to the circumcircle of $ABC$ intersect at $T$. Prove that line $TH$ passes through one of the intersections of circles $ADT$ with $MHN$.
