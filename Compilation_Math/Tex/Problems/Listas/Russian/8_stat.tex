\begin{problem}
    [\cite{BCXRUSSIAN} \gad ] 
    Each point of a three-dimensional space is colored
    with one of two colors such that
    whenever an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $AB = AC$
    has vertices of the same color $c$ it follows that
    the midpoint of $BC$ also is colored with $c$.
    Prove that there exists a perpendicular square prism
    with all vertices of equal color.
