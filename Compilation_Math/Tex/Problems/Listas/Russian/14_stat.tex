\begin{problem}
    [\cite{BCXRUSSIAN} Rusia 1995 \gad]
  There are three boxes of stones. Each hour, Sisyphus moves a stone from one box to another. For each transfer of a stone, he receives from Zeus a number of coins equal to the number of stones in the box from which the stone is drawn minus the number of stones in the recipient box, with the stone Sisyphus just carried not counted. If this number is negative, Sisyphus pays the corresponding amount (and can pay later if he is broke).

After 
 hours, all the stones lie in their initial boxes. What is the greatest possible earning of Sisyphus at that moment, in terms of the initial quantities in the three boxes?
