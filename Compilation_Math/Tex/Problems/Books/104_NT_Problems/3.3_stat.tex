\begin{problem} [\cite{104NT}/ 3.3]

   Most positive integers can be expressed as a sum of two or more 
   consecutive positive integers. For example, $24=7+8+9$ and 
   $51=25+26$. A positive integer that cannot be expressed as a 
   sum of two or more consecutive integers is therefore 
   interesting. What are all interesting integers?
