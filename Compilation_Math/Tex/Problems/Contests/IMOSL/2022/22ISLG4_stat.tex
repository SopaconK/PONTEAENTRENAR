    Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AC > AB$, let $O$ be its circumcentre, and let $D$ be a point on the segment $BC$. The line through $D$ perpendicular to $BC$ intersects the lines $AO, AC,$ and $AB$ at $W, X,$ and $Y,$ respectively. The circumcircles of triangles $AXY$ and $ABC$ intersect again at $Z \ne A$.
Prove that if $W \ne D$ and $OW = OD,$ then $DZ$ is tangent to the circle $AXY.$
