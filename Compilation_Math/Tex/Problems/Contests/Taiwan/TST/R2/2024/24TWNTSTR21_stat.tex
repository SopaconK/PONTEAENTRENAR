    Given triangle $ABC$. Let $BPCQ$ be a parallelogram ($P$ is not on $BC$). Let $U$ be the intersection of $CA$ and $BP$, $V$ be the intersection of $AB$ and $CP$, $X$ be the intersection of $CA$ and the circumcircle of triangle $ABQ$ distinct from $A$, and $Y$ be the intersection of $AB$ and the circumcircle of triangle $ACQ$ distinct from $A$.
Prove that $\overline{BU} = \overline{CV}$ if and only if the lines $AQ$, $BX$, and $CY$ are concurrent.
