\begin{problem}
    [\href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h3453754p33342568}{PEMNAS 2023/S1}]
    On the board are written the numbers $2$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\sqrt{\frac{3}{5}}$. Pepem will perform a game, where each step follows the following step:

(1). Pepem selects two numbers on the board, say $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the condition $ab>1$.
(2). The two selected numbers are deleted, then two new numbers are written on the board, namely $a-\frac{1}{b}$ and $b+\frac{1}{a}$.

If the above steps cannot be performed at some point, then the game is stopped. Is it possible for the game to stop with the numbers written on the board being $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$?
